    <h2>Plants</h2>
Plants are predominantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis" target="_blank">photosynthetic</a> eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.Historically, the 
plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae 
and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some 
algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one definition, 
plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants") which is sister of 
the Glaucophyta, and consists of the green algae and Embryophyta (land plants). The 
latter includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their 
allies, hornworts, liverworts, and mosses.

Most plants are multicellular organisms. Green plants obtain most of their energy from 
sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from 
endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, 
which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic and have lost the 
ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize. Plants are 
characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, but asexual 
reproduction is also common.

There are about 320,000 known species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260,
000, produce seeds. Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's 
molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems. Plants that produce 
grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated 
for millennia. Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building 
materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of 
medicines and psychoactive drugs. The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a 
branch of biology.

<h2 style="font-size:35px;">Definition</h2><hr>
<p style="font-size: 24px;">
All living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants and animals. This classification dates from Aristotle (384–322 BC), who made the distinction between plants, which generally do not move, and animals, which often are mobile to catch their food. Much later, when Linnaeus (1707–1778) created the basis of the modern system of scientific classification, these two groups became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Metaphyta or Plantae) and Animalia (also called Metazoa). Since then, it has become clear that the plant kingdom as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. The term "plant" implies cell walls containing cellulose, and the ability to carry out photosynthesis with chloroplasts; many familiar plants are multicellular.
